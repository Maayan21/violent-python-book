# About

This repository contains program files for the ["Violent Python"](https://www.amazon.com/Violent-Python-Cookbook-Penetration-Engineers/dp/1597499579) book, which I use to study Python. I decided to code exercizes on my own before looking to provided code samples due to several reasons:

* I am not a novice in programming but examples from the middle of the book gave me impression that they are written for the beginner-to-average programmer
* Copying helps to learn but making your own research and attempts helps better
* I want to code in my own style

Some programs are omited becuse they are too trivial to code.

These exercizes were not made suitable for anybody's use except mine. However, if you find them useful, feel fre to use them.
